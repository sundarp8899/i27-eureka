Hello! Here's a **simple and clear real-time scenario** to demonstrate **absolute and relative paths**, assuming your home directory is `/home/rama`.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Scenario: Navigating Project Files**

Assume youâ€™re working on a project with the following folder structure:

```
/home/rama/
â”œâ”€â”€ project/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deploy.sh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ settings.json
```

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Access `settings.json` from `deploy.sh`

---

### âœ… **Absolute Path Usage**

From inside the `deploy.sh` script, you want to access `settings.json` using the **absolute path**:

```bash
cat /home/rama/project/config/settings.json
```

* **Always starts from root `/`**
* Works from **anywhere** in the system
* **Never breaks** even if your current directory changes

---

### âœ… **Relative Path Usage**

If you're **already inside** the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
cd /home/rama/project/scripts
cat ../config/settings.json
```

* Starts **relative to current directory**
* `..` goes **one level up** to `project/`
* Then navigates into `config/`

| Concept       | Command Example                               | From Where?                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Absolute Path | `cat /home/rama/project/config/settings.json` | Anywhere in the system                 |
| Relative Path | `cat ../config/settings.json`                 | Only from `/home/rama/project/scripts` |
